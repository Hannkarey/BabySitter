              Finding a babysitter or nanny is a solution that many couples turn
              to, only that, finding someone they trust, nearby and able to take
              care of a baby or a child. Even from an elderly person is
              something difficult to find. This is why i decided to
              create this social platform in Kenya, FindTheBestNanny, which allows
              couples to contact babysitters, and nannies will be delighted to
              take care of their children.
